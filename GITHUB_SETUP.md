# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `diabetes_prediction`
3. Description: "Machine Learning project for diabetes prediction using PIMA Indians Diabetes Database"
4. **Select "Private"** (important!)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/Nilesh/Desktop/EasternUniversity/Capstone Project/Approved_Proposal/Cursor_diabtestPred"

# Add the remote repository (already done - username: nileshkadale2020)
git remote add origin https://github.com/nileshkadale2020/diabetes_prediction.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/nileshkadale2020/diabetes_prediction`
2. Verify all files are uploaded
3. Check that the repository is marked as "Private"

## What's Included in the Repository

✅ Source code (src/)
✅ Flask application (app/)
✅ Jupyter notebook (notebooks/)
✅ Documentation (README, PRESENTATION_SCRIPT, etc.)
✅ Configuration files (requirements.txt, .gitignore)
✅ Project proposal PDF

❌ Virtual environment (dtsc691/) - excluded via .gitignore
❌ Model files (*.pkl, *.h5) - excluded via .gitignore
❌ Data files (*.csv) - excluded via .gitignore
❌ Large visualization files - excluded via .gitignore

## Notes

- The virtual environment is excluded because it's large and can be recreated using `requirements.txt`
- Model files are excluded because they're large and can be regenerated by running the training scripts
- Data files are excluded for privacy and size reasons
- Users can download the dataset using `download_data.py` or from Kaggle
